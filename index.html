  <h2> Diversity Matters. </h2>

<p> Games are a uniquely immersive art form. They pull you into their handcrafted worlds, battles, and stories with chill-rendering soundtracks and enticing gameplay. Unlike film and other forms of media, you’re not just a viewer or a reader; you’re the player. You’re effectively the protagonist of the story you engage with, and that’s really meaningful.
  </p>

<p> Now, imagine playing a game and everyone kept calling you something that you’re not. Even worse, your character in the game nods along to that even though that’s not how you, the player, truly identifies.
  </p>

<p> As you might expect, this can cause a major disconnect between the player and the game. The world the game is trying to pull you into has now accidentally excluded you; that carefully crafted immersion is now broken.
  </p>

<p> This is why diversity is key in games. If games can allow the player to cater their character to their own identity, it can preserve that immersive quality games are known for.
