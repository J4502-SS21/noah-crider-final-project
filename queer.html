<h3><a href="transgender.hmtl"> Queer Representation in Gaming</a></h3>

<p> Queer representation in games is a difficult subject to tackle. Since the term “queer” is so flexible, it’s not common to see many game developers outwardly consider a character queer.
</p>

<p> There are some exceptions, however. In an interview on The Last of Us: Part 2, the voice actor for Ellie called her a queer character, which is a pretty uncommon occurrence in the AAA gaming scene.
</p>

<p> One of the most commonly cited queer characters has never been confirmed to be queer by the developers, but the character’s story is perfectly reflective of the queer experience. </p>

<p> Persona 4 Golden, the cult-classic JRPG and coming-of-age story, features a character named Kanji Tatsumi. Kanji wears japanese punk biker clothes, and talks like a delinquent: the typical “bad guy” type we see in a lot of fiction. </p>

<p> However, there’s a much softer side to Kanji. His family owns a fabric store in the town the game takes place in, and through that he found a genuine passion for sewing and fabrics. </p>

<p> As the game goes on, more is revealed about Kanji’s inner workings. He may have a scary exterior, but on the inside he deals with some identity conflicts. He wants to be more feminine, more fabulous; Kanji’s problems speak perfectly to some common struggles queer people face. </p>

<p> Part of the problem with this representation is that it doesn’t say anything explicitly. It sits in that vague area where it could be considered good representation, but doesn’t say enough or stick the landing strong enough to truly be helpful. Another problem is that there’s a lot of pushback from the other characters in the story about Kanji’s softer side, which could be pretty damaging to anyone who relates to Kanji as a character. </p>
