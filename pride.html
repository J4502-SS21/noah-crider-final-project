      <h2 class="holder2head"> Game development demands diversity. </h2>
      <p class="holder2text"> The games industry, like many other industries, has had a long, troubled past with LGBTQIA+ diversity in the workforce.  A UK-based games industry census found that 70% of workers in the industry are male, 28% are female, and only 2% are non-binary. It was (and still is) rare to see someone who identifies as LGBTQIA+ in a leadership or management position at a games studio or publisher. </p>
      <p class="holder2text"> This has had a drastic effect on the games that we make. Games can’t tell diverse, deep, interesting stories if everyone that works in the industry identifies the same way and is from the same place. Without a variety of diverse perspectives, games ultimately miss their fullest potential; to connect with people using an interactive art form. </p>
      <p class="holder2text"> However, it’s not all bad. We’ve actually seen some great progress in the last few decades in terms of LGBTQIA+ inclusion in the workforce. In the Indie game scene, many studios involve diverse people in working and leadership roles. AAA studios are still a bit behind in terms of diversity, but given that games are telling more diverse stories, we are getting somewhere. </p>
      <p class="holder2text"> Truly, game development needs diversity to get anywhere. Without diversity, games can feel generic and uninspired. They can even feed into damaging stereotypes because nobody was there during the writing and production process to stop that from happening. </p>
      <p class="holder2text"> There are a lot of champions of LGBTQIA+ diversity in the games industry, across both AAA and Indie studios. Without people pushing boundaries like they do, games wouldn’t be the same. </p>
      <p class="holder2text"> Here are a few of those people. </p>

  <h2> AAA: David Gaider (he/him) - Lead writer at Bioware </h2>
  <p> In the AAA industry, we often see that there isn’t a lot of LGBTQIA+ representation in leading industry roles. Diversity in the AAA industry has been a hot topic for quite some time; after all, if games want to tell diverse stories, there should be diverse people looking at the scripts. </p>
  <p> Dragon Age is one of Bioware’s flagship roleplaying games. The series is set within a rich fantasy setting, with lots of characters and even some romance options built into the game. Many of Bioware’s games are well known for their knack for creating interesting romantic relationships for the player. </p>
  <p> Dragon Age was also one of the earliest AAA roleplaying games to include gay and lesbian romantic couplings. None other than the lead writer, David Gaider, can be thanked for that. As an openly gay man himself, Gaider lead the charge for including homosexual relationships in AAA games well before many studios could even muster one LGBTQIA+ character in their games. </p>

  <h2> Indie: Maddy Thorson (they/them) - Developer of Celeste </h2>
  <p> When the indie platformer Celeste hit store shelves, the internet practically exploded. The game tells a beautiful story about coming to terms with oneself and climbing a mountain. The music was beautiful, and the game was made by just a few passionate people. </p>
  <p> The main character of Celeste, Madeline, faces her inner struggles and figures herself out as she climbs Mount Celeste. It’s one of the few platformers released in the last decade to feature a woman-presenting protagonist, but that’s not the whole story. </p>
  <p> In a post-launch update for Celeste, Madeline was confirmed to be a trans woman. Around the time of this announcement, Maddy Thorson, one of the lead developers of Celeste, came out as queer non-binary to the world. It’s a beautiful moment in gaming history that many look back on fondly. </p>
  <p> Maddy Thorson was very brave to come out like they did, and it paid off. They showed the industry that great games can come from diverse people. This moment not only stands as a crowning achievement for game diversity, but for trans pride as a whole. </p>
