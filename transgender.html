<h3><a href="transgender.hmtl"> Transgender and Nonbinary Representation in Gaming</a></h3>

<p> While gay representation has definitely had its ups and downs, trans representation has been even more of a rocky road. The trans experience is something that’s really hard to nail down for games, so there are a lot of negative, unhelpful representations across media.
</p>

<p> Games are unfortunately no exception to this. There are a few notable exceptions, but things have only truly improved in the last five or so years. The most notable trans character in gaming right now, in my eyes, would be none other than Madeline from Celeste. </p>

<p> Celeste is an indie platformer developed by a small team and released in 2018. The game received universal acclaim, being touted as one of the best games of 2018 as well as one of the best games ever made. </p>

<p> The game tells the story of Madeline, a girl looking to climb Mount Celeste. Madeline must face her inner worries, fears, and anxieties, and work together with her friends to reach the peak. It’s a great game, and a great story about learning to lean on others and learning to better yourself. </p>

<p> In a post-release update, Madeline was confirmed to be a trans woman. At the same time, the developer came out as trans themselves, and the internet celebrated. This whole event is frequently cited as a huge step forward for representation both in games and in the industry itself. </p>

<p> Nonbinary representation in gaming has seen a similarly rocky road. While gay representation at least saw tokenistic characters, it was incredibly rare to see nonbinary characters show up in any game until the 2010’s.
</p>

<p> One of the most prominent examples of a strong nonbinary character in modern gaming is none other than Fl4k, the beastmaster robot from Borderlands 3. </p>

<p> Surprisingly, the Borderlands series has actually led the charge in the AAA space for LGBTQIA+ representation. It features a respectably sized cast of gay, lesbian, trans, and nonbinary characters. Fl4k is especially important because he’s one of the 4 main playable characters in Borderlands 3, allowing the player an opportunity to pick a character that might fit their identity best.
</p>

<p> Another great side effect of having a nonbinary main character is that it gives players who are not nonbinary a chance to relate to someone who is. Player characters are a great way of bridging the gap, allowing those of us who are cisgendered to see things from a new perspective.

<h2 class="holder2head"> What if I want to make my own trans character? </h2>
<p class="holder2text"> Unfortunately, games are still a bit behind the times when it comes to allowing trans characters and nonbinary characters. A lot of character creators are gender-locked, meaning that you can’t wear makeup as a man-presenting character for example. There aren’t many games that allow you explicitly create a character who is trans, but there are some exceptions.

</p>

<p class="holder2text"> One of the most famous trans-inclusive character creators is found in CD Projekt Red’s blockbuster action game Cyberpunk 2077. In the character creator, you are given full freedom to realize the main character’s gender identity, hair, makeup, and they even allow genitalia customization.
</p>

<p class="holder2text"> That being said, Cyberpunk 2077 is a mixed bag for trans representation, since it features a lot of stereotyping and sex-heavy language that can alienate trans players. Suffice it to say, it’s a mixed bag; proceed with caution.
