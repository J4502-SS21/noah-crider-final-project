  <h2> LGBTQIA+ Terms to understand: </h2>
  <h3> Gender</h3>
  <p> To put it in the most simple terms, gender is how you act and/or identify as a person. It’s who you are. Gender expression is performative, meaning it’s something that we act out naturally. Gender expression can be anything from a masculine walk to a feminine laugh, or anything in between. Gender is not only a social construct, our interpretation of it changes over time. </p>

  <h3> Sexuality</h3>
  <p>Sexuality is what you like and what you don’t. It involves romantic, emotional, and/or sexual attraction to a person based on their characteristics. </p>

  <h3> Transgender</h3>
  <p> It’s an umbrella term for people whose gender identity differs from the gender/sex they were assigned at birth. Trans people often deal with gender dysphoria, a clinical condition in which they feel disassociated from their body because it doesn’t match who they truly are. </p>

  <h3> Nonbinary</h3>
  <p> Nonbinary people fall under the category of transgender people. They not only identify differently than the gender/sex that was assigned to them at birth, but they express themselves outside of the bounds of the gender spectrum altogether. For example, someone who is nonbinary might wear a dress and grow facial hair. Nonbinary people toss the gender rulebook out the window, and they are often much happier for it. </p>

  <h3> Queer</h3>
  <p>Queer is an umbrella term for sexual/gender expressions and identities that don’t fit neatly into any one specific category. It’s often used as a “catch-all” term for people in the LGBTQIA+ community. People who identify as queer often have their own reasons for it, which gives the term its unique value. </p>

  <h2> Game Terms to Understand: </h2>
  <h3> AAA (Pronounced "Triple A"): </h3>
  <p> AAA is an overarching term for studios, games, and companies that are funded by a large-scale publisher. For example, games like Call of Duty are massive, blockbuster games with huge companies developing and bankrolling them. Any game, or studio that’s in the big leagues like that fits neatly into the AAA category. AAA games are a good metric for seeing where the industry is at as a whole in terms of LGBTQIA+ representation. </p>

  <h3> Indie: </h3>
  <p> Indie is an umbrella term for studios, games, and companies that are often self-published and smaller scale. Indie games are often made by teams of less than five people, and are often funded by crowdfunding or donations. Indie games often lead the charge in LGBTQIA+ representation, paving the way for larger companies to follow suit. </p>

  <h2 class="holder2head"> What does good representation look like? </h2>
  <p class="holder2text"> Generally speaking, good LGBTQIA+ representation pushes boundaries. For a long time, games have focused on the stories of straight, cis men and women. In order to create stories, worlds, and games that include everyone, we need diverse stories that push the envelope for what’s possible in the medium. </p>
  <p class="holder2text"> Good representation includes LGBTQIA+ people and their personalities, interests, and struggles in ways that don’t perpetuate stereotypes or problematic language. Good representation doesn’t even have to focus purely on the LGBTQIA+ person in question; a simple nod is often all you need. </p>
  <h2 class="holder2head"> What does bad representation look like? </h2>
  <p class="holder2text"> Bad representation is unfortunately much more common in the games industry, historically speaking. Bad representation often perpetuates, worsens, or broadens LGBTQIA+ stereotypes without an effective remedy to that. Bad representation can alienate people from playing games, and can even encourage online harassment. </p>
